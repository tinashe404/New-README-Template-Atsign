# Priv@teFit
Priv@teFit is an open-source app allowing consumers to share health data with each other through a peer-to-peer encrypted connection. This originated as a winning project at HackPrinceton 2021 project by Raheem Idowu and Michelle Liu. We welcome contributions to the app (see Issues tab) via pull requests and want to hear about ideas for new issues!

## Who is this for?
This project is intended for any developer or designer interested in creating apps in Flutter and contributing to health data privacy. 

## How to Contribute as a Developer
We have issues open for prioritized app features that open-source developers. Feel free to add ideas for features or bug fixes as issues on this repo. Contributions should be submitted as pull requests for review. See the CONTRIBUTING.md guide for more details! Issues # 1-3 are prioritized as they are required for most other fitness app features to be implemented.

## How to Contribute as a Designer
We have issues open for prioritized app features to be designed and implemented. For each feature, designers can submit links to Figma / Adobe XD as a comment on the GitHub Issue. In particular, this current issue requires a new design (https://github.com/atsign-foundation/privatefit/issues/3).

## Why The @platform
This open-source app is built on the @platform, a set of tools allowing developers to leverage existing app patterns to make use of the @protocol. The @protocal allows two parties to securely exchange information (end-to-end encrypted). This technology was created by The @ Company (atsign.com). This project leverages the @platform to accelerate Flutter development and ensure those who use the app have control over their data. See this developer website for more information about the technology (atsign.dev).
